1.  ABSTARCT for the Project Fashion MNIST Data Classifier
   
   In this project, we have built a fashion apparel recognition using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. To train the CNN model, we have used the Fashion MNIST dataset. After successful training, the CNN model can predict the name of the class given apparel item belongs to. This is a multiclass classification problem in which there are 10 apparel classes the items will be classified. 
   The fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28 grayscale images, associated with a label from 10 classes. So the end goal is to train and test the model using Convolution neural network

3.  ABSTARCT for the Project Profit Prediction

      In the given dataset(50_Startups.csv) , R&D Spend, Administration Cost and Marketing Spend of 50 Companies are given along with the profit earned. The target is to prepare an ML model which can predict the profit value of a company if the value of its R&D Spend, Administration Cost and Marketing Spend are given.
